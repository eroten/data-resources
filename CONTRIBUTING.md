# Welcome!

Welcome! This is a repository I've put together with resources that helped me learn. It's meant to grow over time and I have my own visions of how I want it to grow, but I'd also love for other people to be involved. Everyone has a different learning process and different resources they find helpful. I want to be accessible to the broader community and cognizant of different learning styles, and I'm hoping you can help with that! 

## How to contribute

There are two ways you can contribute to this repository. 

1. Submit a pull request

In your pull request, please add your resource around the existing ones. I likely won't accept a pull request that deletes something I've already written. Also, add a short note about why you think this resource should be included!

2. Add an issue

If you're not sure how to submit a pull request or just want to suggest a more general thing (i.e., a new category), issues are a great way to do that! If you're submitting a resource, add a link and a short bit about why it's useful for you. If you're suggesting something broader, I'd love to hear your thoughts! 

## What to contribute

* Links! I'm especially looking for links to news sites and existing datasets/repositories. At the moment I don't have an API section, but I think that would be a good thing to have if it's focused on data rather than web development. 

* Code snippets. 
  * Learn something cool? Find a shortcut? Leave lots of comments so I can follow your thought process and post it here! Either find a section you think it goes in or create a new one. 
  
* Something helpful I haven't thought of? Let me know!
